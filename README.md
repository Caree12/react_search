<h1>Real time search in React</h1>

This is a simple real time search tool in react with webpack pulling from a list of products specified in a json file. 
This can be modified to search different products, books, or anything your heart desires! Can even be set up to pull from the back end.

<h2>To Use:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>clone the repo</li>
  <li>install react - $npm install --save react react-dom</li>
  <li>install the dependencies - $npm install</li> 
  <li>set up and run the server - $npm run serve</li>
 </ul>

Webpack will tell you which port the app is running on. (The default is http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/)

Enjoy the search!
