<h1>Real time search in React</h1>

This is a simple real time search tool in react with webpack pulling from a list of products specified in a json file. 
This can be modified to search different products, books, or anything your heart desires! Can even be set up to pull from the back end.

<h2>To Use:</h2>
clone the repo
install react - $npm install --save react react-dom
install the dependencies - $npm install 
set up and run the server - $npm run serve

Webpack will tell you which port the app is running on. (The default is http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/)

Enjoy the search!
